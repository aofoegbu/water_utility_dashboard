3. High-priority tickets trigger work order creation
4. Work order automatically assigned to available technician
5. Integration logged for audit trail
```

### Work Order Completion Flow
```
1. Technician completes work order in ERP
2. System updates work order status to "completed"
3. Related service ticket automatically marked "resolved"
4. Customer notification sent (simulated)
5. Integration activity logged
```
