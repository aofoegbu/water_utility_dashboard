## 📋 Business Case

Enterprise organizations typically operate multiple specialized systems:
- **CRM Systems** (Salesforce, HubSpot) manage customer relationships, sales pipelines, and support tickets
- **ERP Systems** (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics) handle financials, inventory, orders, and operations
- **Integration Layer** ensures real-time data consistency and automated workflows

This project demonstrates the technical expertise required to design, implement, and maintain these critical business integrations.
